# Spotify New Music Automation

Automates organization of new music in Spotify.

When a user adds song to a specific playlist ("new"), add it to "main" playlist and current month's playlist. Once a song has been in new for 30 days, it is removed from the playlist (to keep new up to date).

## Setup
1. Install poetry: \
    `pipx install poetry`
2. Install dependencies with \
   `poetry install`
